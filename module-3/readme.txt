Most of the problems in this module are adapted from labs of last year's ENGG1111

Last year's team of TA have created a YouTube channel dedicated in demonstrating solutions of the lab problems (and extra problems if you need further practices),
if you want video tutorials of this module, you may find the materials on this channel:
